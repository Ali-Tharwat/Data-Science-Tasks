# üìä Data Science Tasks:
 ## Loan Approval, Employee Attrition, and Customer Segmentation  

## üîç Overview  
This repository contains three distinct data science python projects, each addressing a unique problem using advanced analytical techniques. The projects include:  
1. **Loan Approval Dataset Analysis**: Explores applicant features to inform loan approval decisions.  
2. **Employee Attrition Prediction**: Predicts employee attrition using machine learning models.  
3. **Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis**: Segments customers into groups for targeted marketing strategies.  

Each project is designed to uncover actionable insights and demonstrate proficiency in data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and visualization.

## üìÇ Projects  

### 1. üìä **Loan Approval Dataset Analysis**  
- **Goal**: Analyze loan applicant data to identify patterns and relationships for better approval decisions.  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  - Data exploration and cleaning.  
  - Feature engineering (`Income_to_Loan_Ratio`, `EMI`).  
  - Visualizations (boxplots, histograms, scatterplots).  
- **Insights**: Higher-income applicants tend to request larger loans; new features enhance risk assessment.  
- **Python libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  

### 2. üë• **Employee Attrition Prediction**  
- **Goal**: Predict employee attrition using machine learning models to identify at-risk employees.  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  - Data preparation (encoding, scaling).  
  - Model training (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, MLP).  
  - Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).  
- **Insights**: KNN performed best with balanced precision/recall; class imbalance was a challenge.  
- **Python libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras.  

### 3. üõçÔ∏è **Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis**  
- **Goal**: Segment mall customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing.  
- **Key Tasks**:  
  - Data preparation (encoding, scaling, PCA).  
  - Clustering (KMeans, Agglomerative, GMM, BIRCH).  
  - Evaluation (Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index).  
- **Insights**: KMeans was most effective for clear, interpretable clusters.  
- **Python libraries**: Pandas, Numpy , Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
